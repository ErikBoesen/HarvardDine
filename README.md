# HarvardDine

> A powerful API for Harvard's dining services.

## Motivation
Harvard does not maintain an open API allowing third-party apps and projects to obtain dining hall data. This leaves students wishing to use that data in their projects to perform the laborious process of HTML scraping Harvard's websites to get the data they need.

HarvardDine performs this scraping behind the scenes, and serves the data as JSON through a simple API.
